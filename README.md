# Dark Mode Everywhere Extension

## Description

Dark Mode Everywhere is a browser extension that dynamically applies a dark theme to all websites you visit, reducing eye strain and improving your browsing experience in low-light conditions. It intelligently detects pages with light backgrounds and inverts colors to a dark mode, while preserving the original theme on websites that already implement their own dark mode.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP file and extract it.
2. Open your browser and navigate to the extensions page:
   - **Chrome**: chrome://extensions/
   - **Firefox**: about:addons
   - **Edge**: edge://extensions/
3. Enable 'Developer Mode' (for Chrome and Edge).
4. Click 'Load unpacked' (for Chrome and Edge) or 'Install Add-on From File' (for Firefox).
5. Select the directory where you have saved the unzipped extension files.

## Features

- **Automatic Dark Mode**: Automatically applies a dark theme to websites with light backgrounds.
- **Intelligent Theme Detection**: Detects if a website already uses a dark theme and avoids double inversion.
- **Customizable**: Users can toggle dark mode on and off for individual websites.

## Usage

After installation, the extension will automatically start converting light-themed pages to dark mode. You can click on the extension icon in the browser toolbar to toggle the dark mode for the current site.
